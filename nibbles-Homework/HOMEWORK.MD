NIBBLES HOMEWORK
================
This is the homework set after completion of the Nibbles C++ SFML tutorial.

* [x] Change the number of apples required to progress to the next level into a variable in the Engine class, 
and change it to 5
* [x] Make it so the speed only increases when you load a new level instead of when you eat apples. Start the speed a 
bit faster though, or the first couple of levels will be quite slow.
* [x] Add a couple of 'cheat' keys
  * [x] SPACE - add snake section
  * [x] M - move the apple
  * [x] L - load the next level
* [x] Can you find any code that we didn't actually use in the project. Or do you have any ideas on how to improve 
the code. I have some ideas; but I'd love to see yours.
* [ ] Your choice - surprise me (I'm excited to see what you come up with)
* [x] **BONUS** - Change the level files so that you can set the starting position and length of the snake. You could 
use the 'h' character to denote the head, and the 's' character to denote the body sections. Then in the engine, 
build a function to load in the snake from the level file. The trick will be to work out how the snake connects. 
Some loops will be required. With this, you could make some levels super hard by 
starting the game with a really long snake.
